# AttendanceSystemNew

This is a web-based application using PHP that allows students to apply for attendance requests to their concerned faculties. The application aims to streamline the process of requesting and approving attendance for students, making it more efficient and convenient for both students and faculties. 

Attendance request management is a common issue for many educational institutions, as it can impact their overall attendance. In most cases, students are required to follow a specific process to request and receive approval for attendance, which can involve filling out paper forms or sending emails to their concerned faculties. However, these methods can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to track and manage. 

To address these issues, many educational institutions have turned to computer-based solutions for attendance request management, such as software applications or web-based systems. These solutions can streamline the process of requesting and approving attendance, making it more efficient and convenient for both students and faculties. 

This application deals with the attendance maintenance of the students on a daily basis. The faculties who are handling respective subjects can mark the attendance of the students within this application. Students can view their attendance and can also request attendance that they are going to miss in the future. Both the faculties and students are given unique usernames and passwords to log in through the application.  

Whenever the students must attend any events related to sports, arts, science, technology, etc there are high chances that they might miss attendance. Later it’s difficult for both students and faculties to track back those dates that they have missed and mark those attendances. So, to overcome that problem I have developed a web application that is supported on every device to request those attendances. So, if a student must attend any event, then he/she must simply log in and request attendance of that class. The faculty of that desired course will receive the request from the student and then can send it to the desired faculty who is part of organizing that event.
